# Yolo-Detection-Framework

This Framework Allows Machine Learning Engineers to Train YOLO algorithm for Object Detection from scratch without using any external object detection framework,Retrain an existing model and Using an existing model to predict

 - Currently the Dataset Used is Pascal VOC(2012), The training set of Pascal VOC(2012) can be  found here:

 - And the test set can be found here:

NOTE: Not All the testset is being annotated ,A round 5000 images only are being annotated,it's recommended to use training data for training and validating.
